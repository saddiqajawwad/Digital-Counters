 ## Digital Counters – DLD Project (Multisim)

This repository contains a collection of Digital Logic Design (DLD) counters designed and simulated using NI Multisim.  
The project focuses on the implementation and analysis of synchronous and asynchronous counters using flip-flops.

## Tools and Technologies
- NI Multisim
- Digital Logic Design concepts
- JK, D, and T Flip-Flops

## Project Contents
- Multiple synchronous counter designs
- Multiple asynchronous counter designs
- A final project consisting of an asynchronous digital clock

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ms14` files using NI Multisim.
3. Run the simulations to observe counter behavior and outputs.

## Notes
- NI Multisim is required to open and run the simulation files.
