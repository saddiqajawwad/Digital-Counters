# Synchronous Counters – DLD Project

This folder contains a set of synchronous counter designs created and simulated using NI Multisim.  
These counters demonstrate the behavior and implementation of synchronous counters using various types of flip-flops.

## Counters Included

1. **3-bit Up Counter**  
   - A basic 3-bit synchronous up counter using JK/D flip-flops.  
   - Counts from 0 to 7.

2. **Even-Odd Counter (Using D Flip-Flops)**  
   - Synchronous counter that alternates between even and odd numbers.  
   - Demonstrates counting logic with D flip-flops.

3. **Even-Odd Counter (Using T Flip-Flops)**  
   - Synchronous counter that alternates between even and odd numbers.  
   - Demonstrates counting logic with T flip-flops.

4. **Random Sequence Counter**  
   - A synchronous counter that follows the custom sequence:  
     `0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 0 → 1 → 3 ...`  
   - Demonstrates **non-linear counting** and custom state sequencing.  
   - Useful for understanding random sequence generation using flip-flops.

## How to Use
1. Open the `.ms14` files in NI Multisim.  
2. Run the simulation to observe each counter’s output and behavior.  
3. Each file is named clearly according to its type.

## Notes
- NI Multisim is required to open and simulate the circuits.  
- Additional documentation such as screenshots or demo videos may be added later.
